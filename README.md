# ChampSelect_NAOPGG_Lookup

Searches NA OP GG for your teammates profiles.



# How to use :

To begin, have  the app open before queue for match pops.

When you get into Champ-Select/Draft phase then copy the entire chatlog, everything.

Paste the contents into the Field on the app.

Press the 'Search' button. Profit.



# Current issues/concerns/plans :

Doesnt parse names if it somehow contains a : in their name.

Doesnt clear the field automatically after each inquiry.


Can remove the app, and enable as a hotkey, and just grab from clipboard.

Can have single button on app, no field, and grab from clipboard.

from clipboard may be quicker, but may be awkward to use for UX.
